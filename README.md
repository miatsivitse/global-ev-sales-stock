This plot shows the increase in EV sales around the world, measured as a percentage of all car sales. Norway were the earliest adopters shown, with 1/3 of new cars sold being electric as early as 2016.
Interestingly, EV sales seem to be leveling off in the EU, as well as in the UK. Each have only shown a ~1% growth in the last year after several years of 4-5% growth.

This plot shows the percentage of new cars sold that are electric for a number of countries, as well as the world as a whole, in 2023.
Scandinavia is leading the way, with almost all car sales in Norway being electric, and 2/3 in Sweden being electric.

This plot shows the growth of EVs in a handful of regions, but most interestingly shows the split between full-battery EVs (BEV) and plug-in hybrids (PHEV).
The full-battery EVs are more popular in all regions when compared to the hybrids. In the regions shown, the full-battery EVs are twice as popular, making up 12% of sales globally in 2023, vs 6% for the hybrids.
One can predict that the trend for both types of EV to continue this upward trend

European countries such as Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom saw a noticeable declines or stagnation in the share of new, fully battery-electric cars sold between 2015 - 2017.
Afterwards, the share of these vehicles sold began to increase. In comparison, China observed a relatively consistent and strong share in the sales of fully battery-electric cars after 2014.
However, the country entered an annual decline beginning in 2021.

This first visualization shows a heat map of the number of electric cars sold in 2023.
It shows the intense regionality of electric cars as a product, with the overwhelming majority of EVs being sold in China, Europe, North Americam, and Oceania.
Virtually no EVs were sold in Africa, central Asia, or the middle east.

This visualization shows the proportion of ALL car sales that are EVs, between 2010 and 2023. The big takeaway here is that, despite the explosive growth of EV car sales in recent years, it is still very much a small part of the overall global auto market.

In this dataset, 'stock' represents the number of cars currently on the road and in use. The plot above shows the share of car stock in each country that is electric.
This plot nicely shows the major uptick in EV use over the last few years, with Norway being big early adopters. In 2023 a staggering 1/3 of cars on the road in Norway are electric, with neighbor Sweden in a distant second place with roughly 1/10. Globally only about 3% of cars in active use are currently EVs, but that is a big increase from even 5 years ago.

This plot looks similar, but instead of showing a percentage it is showing the total count of EVs on the road in the countries/regions. China is a big country by just about any metric, and they are currently dominating this plot with over 40 Million EVs.
This is more than the USA and the EU combined.

This graph shows how as EV stock Share increases, so does oil displacement, meaning less consumption of gasoline and diesel fuels.
You can see how the world has a pretty steep slope with oil consumption decreasing fast worldwide, but in countries like China, even with more EV stock share, they still use a lot of oil and fuel.

![Dash-UV2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea139178-9a38-4dca-8879-3677222d29a1)
This graph shows how Electricity Demand is positively correlated to Oil Displacement. This means as Electricity demand goes up, the amount of Oil needed directly goes down as a result.
This showcases a shift toward renewable energy sources and a reduction in reliance on fossil fuels.

The ratio of EV stock to EV sales for the most recent year (2023) indicates how many EVs a region has on the road in comparison to how many they are selling.
For countries like Norway, this shows that they have a lot of EVS on the road already and the market may already becoming saturated for EVs. In comparison, for countries such as Brazil, India or Australia that have a lower ratio, it indicates that the country is selling a lot of EVs, but does not have many EVs already on the road as of the most recent year.
These countries might demonstrate a desirable or up-and-coming market for EV sales.

Annually, EV sales have grown significantly in the US. Proportionally, sales in the 2020's have been significantly higher compared to the 2010's.

This bubble chart shows a comparison of the BRICS nations that were included in this dataset.
BRICS officially stands for Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, but also includes Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates.
It is an informal group of emerging market economies that are often discussed in business and politics.
This plot shows the % of car sales in the BRICS nations, with the size of the circle being a proportion compared to the other countries in the dataset.
Again, China dominates here, with nearly 40% of new car sales in 2023, but the UAE is accelerating quickly, and the other countries showing big jumps since 2020.

This plot splots up the total EV sales into continental boxes, and it backs up the information we saw in the global heatmap.
Most EV car sales are happening in Asia, Europe, and North America, with the other continents falling extremely far behind. These may be markets to invest in.

## Conclusion
This collection of visualizations show the global trends of electric vehicle (EV) sales globally for the last decade and a half.
Some key takeaways are as follows:EV sales are increasing globally, and the rate that they are increasing is also increasing! The world is starting to go electric.
Looking at total cars on the road, China is unrivaled. Looking at percentage of cars on the road, or percentage of car sales, the undisputed kings of EVs are the Scandanavian countries of Norway and Sweden.
While sales are going up globally, the rate of increase seems to be leveling off in some regions, like Europe
The developing nations categorized as BRICS are lagging behind, but are slowly beginning to catch up in the EV revolution
Full-batter electric cars are much more popular than hybrids in every region, although both are showing growth.
As climate change continues to worsen, solutions like EV cars will be critical. The impact that EV cars have on lessening oil demand should not be underestimated. However, our group fears that it may be too-little too-late. Despite the increase in popularity, EV adoption is still very low globally.
Perhaps solutions should be sought elsewhere. It is naive to think that the industry that has caused this global crisis is going to be reliably able to also come up with the solution.
Out of all the predictive models, XGBoost seems to perform the best with the lowest MSE score, however, all the machine learning models do a poor job of predicting future data.
Observing the ML models to actual projected data from the graphs, linear regression seems to perform the best with a steady increase over time.
Time series models and neural networks such as SARIMA/ARIMA/LSTM may be better adapted for predicting future trends on this dataset.
